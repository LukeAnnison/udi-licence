# UCI Drive

## Overview

**UCI Drive** is a decentralized application built to revolutionize the creative economy by providing a platform where creators can store and value their content. It leverages the power of the Universal Creative Income portal, combining Arweave’s permanent storage technology with Newcoin’s WATT identity proxy. With UCI Drive, creators' content is not just stored but also valued based on a universal, algorithmic identity proxy.

Key Features:

- **Immutable Storage**: Powered by Arweave, UCI Drive ensures your creative assets are future-proof.
- **WATT-Powered Valuation**: Every piece of content uploaded gets a WATT score, providing it with context and value in the creative economy.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Ensure seamless and secure interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.
